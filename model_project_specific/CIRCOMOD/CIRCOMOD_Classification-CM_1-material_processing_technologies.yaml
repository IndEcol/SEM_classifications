    recovery systems.

    - alternative. Includes raw mill, more efficient pre-heaters and pre-calciners,
    rotary kiln with cooler, simple exhaust heat recovery, fuel preparation, improved
    process and fuel control systems,  and improved cooling/heating recovery systems.
  18: Clinker production with oxy-fuel Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) - alternative.
    Includes raw mill, more efficient pre-heaters and pre-calciners, rotary kiln with
    cooler, simple exhaust heat recovery, fuel preparation, improved process and fuel
    control systems,  and improved cooling/heating recovery systems.
  19: "The most widespread type of cement \u2013 Portland (OPC) \u2013 is made of\
    \ 95 % clinker, and of additives for the remaining part. Since clinker production\
    \ is highly energy-intensive, the possibility of mixing it with some inert material\
    \ (with negligible energy intensity, thus low GHG emissions generated during its\
    \ production), or even with scrap from other processes, has been widely studied\
    \ to reduce costs and emissions in the sector. Generally, granulated furnace blast\
    \ scrap (GFBS) and fly ash, produced from coal combustion, are used, along with\
    \ raw materials like natural pozzolans and limestone, depending on local availability."
  20: 'It is an emerging alternative to standard cement, characterized by lower energy
    consumption and environmental costs, exist, even if not yet well-established in
    the sector. A series of binders, generically known as alkali-activated cement
    (AAC), constitute the most prominent of such alternatives. '
  21: "It is one of the four main cement phases present in the standard OPC. In belite\
    \ cements, however, the share of belite is brought up to 40 \xF7 50 %. Clinker\
    \ is here produced with a low lime saturation factor (LSF) \u2013 the ratio of\
    \ CaO to the other oxides \u2013 here in the range 0.72 \xF7 0.80 (in the case\
    \ of OPC clinker, LSF  = 0.90 \xF7 0.98), involving the 19 % lower CO2 emissions\
    \ from calcination (408.5 kg(CO2)/t(cmt)) with respect to the standard process."
  22: "It is the most common process currently employed to produce clinker. The raw\
    \ materials are ground and dried in the form of a flowable powder. This kind of\
    \ plants can be fueled by different sources \u2013 natural gas, oil, biomass or\
    \ coal \u2013 and their efficiency can be increased with the implementation of\
    \ energy-recovery systems (through multi-stage pre-heating, with the use of waste\
    \ energy to pre-heat the raw material flow)."
  23: "The wet version of the clinker production process is less efficient than its\
    \ dry correspondent. The slurry flow getting into the kiln to produce clinker\
    \ has 40\xF745 % of water content and naturally a portion of the heat supplied\
    \ in the in process provokes water evaporation. The wet process is preferred where\
    \ raw materials are available with a moisture content higher than 20 % (and up\
    \ to 45 %)."
  24: Post-combustion CCS is the main candidate for large-scale deployment of carbon
    capture in the cement industry. During combustion, mineral decomposition frees
    a significant amount of CO2 and the pre-combustion techniques would be inefficient.
    The most promising post-combustion technique is the one based on chemical absorption
    with amines.
  25: The main alternative to absorption techniques in the cement sector is the use
    of pure oxygen to fuel the process instead of air (oxy-fuel combustion), in order
    to obtain an outflow of pure CO2 that can be easily captured. The plant layout
    is different from the standard configuration with air, so the post-combustion
    option is usually preferred because of its easier retrofitting.
  26: 'Steelmaking with Standard Coal blast furnace and Basic Oxygen Furnace.  '
  27: Steelmaking with Direct Reduced Iron and Electric Arc Furnace
  28: Steelmaking with Standard EAF/scrap route
  29: Steelmaking with Efficient Coal blast furnace/ BOF (includes premium for Preventive
    maintenance BOF, energy monitoring and management systems BOF, sinter plant heat
    recovery, and energy monitoring and management systems EAF)
  30: Steelmaking with Standard Coal blast furnace / BOF route + CO2 capture
  31: Steelmaking with Smelting reduction + BOF route (Based on COREX technology)
  32: Steelmaking with Smelt reduction + BOF route + CO2 capture (Based on COREX technology)

    heat recovery, Coke dry quenching,  Top gas pressure recovery and recovery of
    Blast Furnace gas, and  Foamy slag practive oxyfuel burners/lancers.
  35: Steelmaking with technology equivalent to Top Gas Recycling Blast furnace/BOF
    plus premium for continuous casting, near net shape casting, injection of natural
    gas at 140 kg/thm, and pulverized coal injection to 225 kg/thm.
  36: Steelmaking with technology equivalent to Top Gas Recycling Blast furnace/BOF
    plus premium for continuous casting, near net shape casting, injection of natural
    gas at 140 kg/thm, and pulverized coal injection to 225 kg/thm w/ CO2 capture.
  37: Steelmaking with Hydrogen-based DRI/EAF
  38: Steelmaking with Electrowinning (Based on SIDERWIN)
  39: "The most used two-step production process for steel. The blast furnace reduces\
    \ iron ore into pig iron, also called hot metal \u2013 the chief ingredient used\
    \ to make the steel \u2013 in this case through oxidation of carbon and silicon\
    \ of the pig iron in a basic oxygen furnace. Further processing in the basic oxygen\
    \ furnace provides crude steel."
  40: Steel is produced starting from solid iron, derived from the direct reduction
    of iron ore, processed in an electric arc furnace . In the direct reduction process,
    natural gas is used as fuel for the reduction of iron ore, and the produced steel
    has lower quality with respect to the BF-BOF product. Several technology options
    exist for the DRI steelmaking route, according to either the kind of employed
    reactor (shaft furnace, rotary kiln, rotary hearth furnace of fluidized bed reactor)
    or the type of iron ore feedstock (pellets and lump ore, or fines and concentrates)
    . The most widely used process for direct reduction the Midrex shaft furnace technology.
  41: 'as alternative to the DRI, ferrous scrap can be used in an electric arc furnace
    to produce liquid steel. Even if many different variations of the process exist,
    and the scrap is often mixed with DRI and pig iron, the best practice here described
    envisages uniquely the use of scrap steel. The use of scrap makes it possible
    to skip a part of the process, and namely the reduction of iron ore, shrinking
    the related energy intensity making this steelmaking route a valuable option,
    often limited only by scarcity of scrap steel or the quality of the amount available. '
  42: 'the most recent technological development commercially available in steelmaking,
    smelting reduction, allows the production of hot metal from iron ore without coke
    . The two existing alternatives for smelting reduction plants are COREX and FINEX,
    the latter being a further development of the first allowing the direct use of
    fine ore. However, COREX is the main technology and is considered the reference
    for this process . COREX is a two-stage process : in the first stage, the iron
    ore is reduced by gases produced in the second stage. The second stage is, indeed,
    the smelter-gasifier unit, in which iron smelting takes place, along with the
    gasification of coal through oxygen. The hot metal produced is then fed into a
    traditional basic oxygen furnace to produce crude steel. The environmental benefits,
    due to the absence of coke in the process, make this technology very interesting.'
  43: 'An enhancement of the traditional scheme, but accounting for an additional
    electricity, consumed for carbon capture by the simplest available technique,
    namely the Pressure Swing Adsorption PSA (the process is considered as available
    starting from 2020). '
  44: 'Also called ULCOS blast furnace, it is a technology developed within the Ultra-Low
    CO2 steelmaking (ULCOS) program, and considered available starting from 2020.
    The top gas produced by the BF is collected, treated and re-used in order to reduce
    coke use for iron ore reduction. Furthermore, the BF-TGR also works with pure
    oxygen instead of air, in order to increase CO2 concentration in the top gas and
    simplify carbon capture . '
  45: The implementation of CCS in a DRI-EAF plant allows this technology to be environmentally
    viable in the future, while keeping the advantages of this kind of route.
  46: "A very promising variation to the traditional DRI-EAF route is the use of hydrogen\
    \ instead of natural gas to reduce the iron, in the hydrogen direct reduction\
    \ (HDR) process. Hydrogen, produced by a clean source \u2013 generally identified\
    \ in an electrolyzer \u2013 is fed into a shaft containing pre-heated iron ore\
    \ to reduce it into hot briquetted iron, ready to undergo the second part of the\
    \ process in a standard EAF. Despite there is so far very little information on\
    \ HDR processes in scientific literature, a commercial plant of this type is already\
    \ in operation in Trinidad [12]. "
  47: 'HIsarna is a next generation process at the pilot stage, very similar to a
    blast furnace, but producing direct reduced iron, developed by Tata Steel and
    Rio Tinto within the framework of the ULCOS program, with the aim of reducing
    the economic burden behind the production of steel while reducing the environmental
    impact of this sector, due to the absence of coke use in the process. The key
    improvement is in the possibility to skip the coking and agglomeration phase,
    directly introducing iron ore and coal in a specifically designed furnace. '
  48: 'The ULCOS project contemplates a second stage for the development of HIsarna,
    where CCS would be introduced. The techniques identified for  capture are the
    PSA and the Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption VPSA (the injection of pure oxygen,
    instead of air, makes HIsarna suitable for CCS) .  HIsarna with CCS works just
    as its standard correspondent but allowing 80 % CO2 emission reduction with respect
    to the current BF . '
  49: 'A DRI technology born within the context of the ULCOS program  . Although it
    is not very different from a DRI-EAF best practice, it envisages the use of VPSA
    for CCS, to cut down CO2 emissions, but with a large use of electricity and higher
    additional costs for such a complex system. Moreover, the use of oxygen instead
    of air produces a flow of concentrated  as off-gas, easing the capture process
    . '
  50: "In Ulcolysis, the decomposition of iron ore into oxygen and liquid metal happens\
    \ at 1500 \xB0C, without the use of coal. After electrowinning, the reduced iron\
    \ ore is passed through an EAF for steelmaking ,  ."
  51: "Ulcowin consists of an aqueous electrolysis of iron oxide at 110 \xB0C, performed\
    \ using coal as fuel ,  ."
  52: Regarding the production of ferroalloys, they include a vast category of alloys
    of iron, chromium, silicon, manganese and others. The combined production of ferrochromium
    FeCr, ferromanganese FeMn, ferrosilicon FeSi and silicomanganese SiMn has constituted
    the largest part of global ferroalloys production during the last 20 years (88
    % in 2002, 72 % in 2011 and 65 % in 2015, thus highlighting a constantly decreasing
    trend  ), so a single technology is used to aggregate all ferroalloys (since data
    for energy consumption are only available for the most traditional ferroalloys),
    and its energy consumption is made up by the weighted average of values related
    to the production of the mentioned ferroalloys between 2011 and 2015. On the other
    hand, the JRC-EU-TIMES only considers ferrochromium as representative for the
    entire production field.
  53: Copper production occurs through a smelting process, and 50 % of global production
    makes use of the Outokumpu flash smelter, which combines the steps needed for
    copper production into a single process. The smelter produces copper concentrate
    (matte), further treated and refined to obtain 99.99 % pure copper, and slag  .
  54: Zinc is third most used non-ferrous metal, behind aluminum and copper  . It
    is used in the production of alloys such as brass. Zinc can be produced via either
    pyrometallurgical (smelting) or hydrometallurgical (electrolysis) process, with
    the latter accounting for more than 90 %  of global material output  . Anyway,
    the use of refined scrap for reducing the energy requirement is always involved,
    thus a single process (hydrometallurgical) is suitable to represent the whole
    production.
  55: "Tin production, which we consider in view of its key role in the manufacturing\
    \ of Low-Critical Temperature Superconductors (LTS), stood at just 264 t/year\
    \ in 2004, a quantity more than 50 times lower than for copper . In recent years,\
    \ demand for tin has increased, but kept stable between 330 \xF7 370 t/year, of\
    \ which 50 \xF7 70 t/year provided through recycling processes. Tin is produced\
    \ through two-stage purification of its ore, via smelting and refining procedures.\
    \ 80 % of global tin resources are constituted by alluvial ore,  and at a global\
    \ level there is no reason to suggest that remaining tin deposits will be unable\
    \ to sustain a long term, gradual upward trend in primary mined tin well into\
    \ the future."
  56: "Titanium is mostly consumed in form of titanium oxide TiO2, while titanium\
    \ sponge metal makes the rest of total demand. Titanium ore can be retrieved from\
    \ ilmenite and rutile, with the former mineral accounting for almost 90 % of world\u2019\
    s consumption of titanium minerals. Titanium is mostly consumed in form of titanium\
    \ oxide TiO2, while titanium sponge metal makes the rest of total demand. Titanium\
    \ ore can be retrieved from ilmenite and rutile, with the former mineral accounting\
    \ for almost 90 % of world\u2019s consumption of titanium minerals. The main production\
    \ is denominated Kroll process . "
  57: 'Niobium is a pretty rare element which has been increasingly requested for
    innovative technological applications. In particular, superconductors employed
    in cutting-edge energy production technologies, for instance the magnetic-confinement
    nuclear fusion machines , are actually made by niobium-based compounds (LTS).
    The current identified resources of niobium are located predominantly in Brazil
    (around), where just few companies control niobium extraction and refining. Among
    them, CBMM supplies approximately of the niobium products, of which are represented
    by ferroniobium. Energy intensity values were obtained by using CBMM energy consumption
    report. '
  58: "The predominant traditional technology to produce alumina is the Bayer process.\
    \ Alumina is almost exclusively used for aluminum manufacturing. Bauxite is the\
    \ main ore employed, so the first step consists in crushing the bauxite and purifying\
    \ it by means of the Bayer process. In the Bayer process, currently adopted to\
    \ produce 90 % of alumina worldwide  the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of\
    \ sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite. The aluminum is precipitated\
    \ out of the solution in form of aluminum hydroxide. Al(OH)3. In the last stage,\
    \ calcination, the hydrate is heated to temperatures of ~ 1000 \xB0C. Under these\
    \ conditions, Al(OH)3 is converted to alumina Al2O3."
  59: "It is the commercially established production process for aluminum (it gives\
    \ 95% of the aluminum production), starting from alumina. Even if two version\
    \ of the process exist, the one base on pre-baked carbon anodes has become predominant.\
    \ In this process aluminum is produced by the electrolytic reduction of alumina,\
    \ dissolved in a molten bath of mainly sodium aluminum fluoride (cryolite) at\
    \ ~ 960 \xB0C. The importance of energy over total cost for producing aluminum\
    \ is huge. For this reason, the process requires constant improvements in terms\
    \ of efficiency.  "
  60: "Secondary aluminum is produced from scrap metal (thus without the strict need\
    \ for alumina), either \u201Cnew\u201D scrap from production and manufacturing\
    \ or \u201Cold\u201D scrap from recycled aluminum."
  61: "Since anodes have to be continuously replaced during the standard Hall-H\xE9\
    roult process, implying additional costs and energy consumption, sectoral R&D\
    \ have been trying to develop alternative anodes which do not get eroded by chemical\
    \ transformations. Commercial deployment of inert anodes is expected by 2030.\
    \ However, these anodes would require the support of a second technology, wettable\
    \ cathodes, i.e. inert titanium diboride TiB2 cathodes which allow the reduction\
    \ of the anode-cathode distance ."
  62: It is the only non-electrochemical process that has shown potential for aluminum
    production. This technology has been the subject to extensive research for more
    than 45 years, but commercial availability is not expected before 2050  .
  63: "The reduction of hydrated alumina silicate (or more commonly kaolinite) Al2O3\
    \ \u2219 2 SiO2 has the potential to earn some consideration over the traditional\
    \ route to produce aluminum, on the long term ."
  64: The most widespread types of kiln is the long rotary kiln (LRK), that accounts
    for the 90 % of the production in the USA.
  65: The melting process is supplied with fossil fuels.
  66: The melting process is supplied with electricity.
  67: Ceramics involve a very diverse range of products, which in turn require a large
    variety of raw materials, according to the desired quality and characteristics.
    By the way, the main steps in the manufacture of ceramic products are largely
    independent of the materials used and the final product.
  68: Steam craking based on ethane.
  69: Steam craking based on gas oil.
  70: Steam cracking based on LPG.
  71: 'A typical steam cracking process is made of three sections [30]. The first
    includes pyrolysis, a high-temperature stage with subsequent gradual quenching,
    where olefins are generated in gaseous form and steam is produced and recirculated
    in the plant to be re-utilized in this same stage. In the second section, primary
    fractionation/compression occurs: liquid matters (when oil-based feedstocks are
    involved) undergo a primary fractionation, while gases (when natural gas-based
    feedstocks are involved) are subject to compression; products of this section
    are fuel oil and BTX, or aromatic gasoline containing BTX. In the last section,
    product recovery/separation, a separation process through distillation, refrigeration
    and extraction.'
  72: A process specifically aiming to produce propylene C3H6.
  73: 'It is a recently-demonstrated catalyst-based technology allowing 20 % energy
    savings with respect to the global average naphtha-based steam cracking, available
    on commercial scale starting from 2010 . '
  74: the methanol-to-olefins route is a commercial-stage technology more energy-intensive
    than steam cracking, since it includes the methanol production stage, but allows
    production of olefins (and aromatics) from non-oil resources as gas and coal (needed
    to produce methanol), as well as from biomass in the longer term .
  75: "The main biomass-based route includes ethylene production from dehydration\
    \ of bioethanol (BDH), characterized by both higher energy consumption (3.5\xF7\
    5 times higher than for fossil-fuel based routes) and costs with respect to the\
    \ other viable alternatives. It is being explored at semi-commercial scale; thus,\
    \ its commercial availability could be supposed for 2025 [31]."
  76: It is a process similar in many aspects to partial oxidation but performed on
    coal.
  77: It is a process similar in many aspects to partial oxidation but performed on
    coal.
  78: Hydrogen is here obtained from steam reforming of coke oven gas and used for
    methanol synthesis.
  79: A hydrogen-rich gas is produced by incomplete combustion, in the presence of
    a sub-stoichiometric amount of air, and used for methanol synthesis.
  80: In steam reforming of methane from natural gas, the most employed route in ammonia
    production, the products from the reaction are CO (consequently recombining with
    steam and producing CO2 and H2) and hydrogen, subsequently used for the synthesis
    of ammonia.
  81: In steam reforming of methane from natural gas, the most employed route in ammonia
    production, the products from the reaction are CO (consequently recombining with
    steam and producing CO2 and H2) and hydrogen, subsequently used for the synthesis
    of ammonia.
  82: Electrolysis is the process used to produce hydrogen, which is then, in turn,
    used to produce ammonia.
  83: Electrolysis is the process used to produce hydrogen, which is then, in turn,
    used to produce ammonia.
  84: The biomass-based version of the gasification process.
  85: The biomass-based version of the gasification process.
  86: This oil-based process is a technologically mature process, which produces a
    hydrogen-rich gas by incomplete combustion, in the presence of a sub-stoichiometric
    amount of air. The reaction is exothermic and catalysts are not required, even
    if they are used in industrial processes to enhance efficiency [32].
  87: 'CCS related to ammonia production has received a great deal of attention since
    in this particular field CCS looks promising, as it is probably more cost-effective
    to be implemented: this can be supposed in relation to the fact that this process
    produces a highly-pure flow of CO2 [33] that does not require an expensive, complex
    and energy-intensive CO2 separation plant. Indeed, commercial implementation of
    the technology is set for 2025 .'
  88: "The mercury cell technique was the first industrial process introduced for\
    \ producing chlorine in Europe . It follows a simple principle: electric current\
    \ flowing through the mercury cell decomposes a solution containing 25 %(wt) sodium\
    \ chloride, commonly referred to as \u201Cbrine\u201D, passing through the narrow\
    \ space between the electrodes, and liberating gaseous chlorine Cl2 at the anode,\
    \ and metallic sodium Na at the cathode. A shallow film of mercury flows along\
    \ with the brine, collecting the sodium once it is liberated at the surface of\
    \ the cathode. The liquid amalgam flows from the electrolytic cell to a separate\
    \ reactor, called \u201Cdecomposer\u201D or \u201Cdenuder\u201D, where it reacts\
    \ with water in presence of a graphite catalyst to form sodium hydroxide NaOH\
    \ and gaseous hydrogen H2. This sodium-free mercury is then fed back into the\
    \ cell and is reused ."
  89: The diaphragm cell is another well-established chlorine production technique.
    It was developed in the 1880s in the United States and was the first commercial
    technique used to produce chlorine and caustic soda from brine . Nowadays, this
    process still monopolizes chlorine production in North America. It is named after
    a component, the diaphragm, which is employed to separate the chlorine liberated
    at the anode, and the hydrogen and caustic soda produced at the cathode. Pre-heating
    of the brine, essential to achieve good yields, is made by steam. This technology
    is as polluting as the mercury-based one, since the diaphragm is produced mainly
    with asbestos.
  90: 'Here, anode and cathode are separated by an ion-conducting membrane. Brine
    solution flows through the anode compartment, where chloride ions are oxidized
    to chlorine gas. Water is electrolyzed at the cathode, releasing gaseous hydrogen
    H2 and hydroxide ions OH-. Sodium and hydroxide ions combine to produce caustic
    soda NaOH, which must be continuously removed '
  91: "This process includes several techniques, all characterized by high yield of\
    \ not-removed lignin (85 \xF7 90 %) and intended to supply low-quality paper production.\
    \ The main advantage is in the high yield of usable pulp produced (in average,\
    \ up to 90 \xF7 95 % of processed wood). Electricity is the main source for driving\
    \ the mechanical forces involved in these processes . Four technologies are mainly\
    \ considered in the class of mechanical pulping , : stone groundwood pulping,\
    \ refiner pulping, thermomechanical pulping (considered as the representative\
    \ for this category) and chemi-thermochemical pulping."
  92: "Semi-chemical pulping is a hybrid process where partial delignification is\
    \ achieved by mild chemical cooking, followed by mechanical defibering. The combination\
    \ of pulping methods produces an intermediate range of pulp yields (55 \xF7 85\
    \ %) . Two common semi-chemical pulping methods exist: neutral sulfite semi-chemical\
    \ pulping (NSSC) and Kraft semi-chemical pulping, see also below. The most used\
    \ and effective in terms of pulp yield is NSSC (75 \xF7 85 %), considered as representative\
    \ for this category."
  93: In 2014, recycled paper covered 55 % of total global demand (producing recovered
    fiber pulp from recycled paper is much less energy consuming with respect to using
    unbleached kraft pulp). Naturally, quality of the paper coming from recycled fiber
    pulping depends on the waste paper source. The yield of produced pulp per tonne
    of recycled paper is therefore strongly dependent of the destination of the final
    product  .
  94: "The Kraft process belongs to the category of chemical pulping, based on the\
    \ degradation of lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules,\
    \ removed from cellulose fibers without decomposing or even weakening the fibers\
    \ themselves. Chemical pulping generally implies high lignin-removal yield (up\
    \ to 45%) . This result can be obtained by different chemical processes, but the\
    \ most successful technique in the field is the Kraft process . In the Kraft (or\
    \ sulphate) process, caustic soda NaOH and sodium sulphate Na2S, blended in a\
    \ chemical mixture called \u201Cwhite liquor\u201D, transform the wood into a\
    \ slurry that contains the intact cellulose fibers. Approximately half of the\
    \ wood is dissolved in what is called \u201Cblack liquor\u201D, mainly made of\
    \ by lignin and hemicellulose. The last part of the process includes bleaching\
    \ and drying of the pulp, when needed for transport to the paper mill (if not\
    \ integrated in the same plant) . A low pulp yield (\u223C 45 % ) is obtained\
    \ from the original wood, thanks to a quite complex system, where a recovery boiler\
    \ burns the black liquor and the biomass (bark) left at the end the pulping process\
    \ ."
  95: "An alternative chemical pulping method is the sulfite process, which is particularly\
    \ used nowadays to fulfil the requirements for chlorine-free products for hygiene\
    \ papers, as well as for printing and writing papers . Sulfite pulp is called\
    \ \u201Cbrown liquor\u201D and can be bleached more easily. The production process,\
    \ however, is similar to the Kraft process . For the purpose of this work, a sulfite\
    \ process provided with energy recovery systems has been assumed as representative.\
    \ The process is characterized by a lower wood requirement with respect to Kraft\
    \ pulping (thus higher yield), quantified in 1.95 t(wood)/t(pulp)  ."
  96: "Black liquor gasification (BLG) is an emerging commercial technology able to\
    \ obtain energy more efficiently from the organic content in the black liquor\
    \ through gasification, producing a combustible gas which after upgrading and\
    \ conditioning results in a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide known as syngas,\
    \ while recovering the inorganic chemical. The hot flue gases from BLG can be\
    \ used to generate steam in a heat boiler, resulting in high pressure steam for\
    \ power generation in a steam turbine. Alternatively, the syngas can be used as\
    \ feedstock for production of biofuels such as dimethyl ether (DME), Fisher-Tropsch\
    \ (FT) fuel, methanol, etc., turning the paper mill into a \u2018refinery\u2019\
    . The EU demonstration project BioDME proved the production of DME from biomass\
    \ and its utilisation in transport and industrial sectors (BioDME FP7, 2017).\
    \ Although less steam is produced compared to the conventional recovery boiler\
    \ (e.g. Tomlinson boiler), the black liquor gasification is considered a future\
    \ key alternative for the recovery boiler as it provides high value products (e.g.\
    \ syngas) or more electricity. About 1.75 tonnes of black liquor (measured as\
    \ dry content) per tonne of pulp can be produced in a bleached kraft pulp mill,\
    \ representing a potential energy source of 250 -500MW per mill (IEA bioenergy,\
    \ 2007)."
  97: 'It is the process by means of which pulp is transformed into actual paper.
    Paper production mainly involves 3 steps: stock preparation, wet end operation
    and dry-end operation. During the first phase raw materials are properly mixed
    to form the raw stock, that will be then processed: pulp, indeed, constitutes
    only a fraction of the total matter that makes paper .'

  157: "In an integrated pulp and paper mill, wood is received at a pulp mill often\
    \ in the form of short logs or bolts of round wood with the bark still attached\
    \ to them. The round wood is frst debarked and then chipped if the pulping process\
    \ requires chemical digestion. The bark is\nshredded and discarded while the chips\
    \ are screened, cleaned, and stored for further processing. In Kraft chemical\
    \ pulping, chips are sent to a large pressure vessel or digester where other chemicals\
    \ are added. The chips are digested with steam to separate fbers and partially\
    \ dissolve the lignin and other extractives. The resulting pulp mix is frst fltered\
    \ to remove large shives, knots, dirt, and other debris and then washed in multiple\
    \ stages.\nBlack liquor is the by-product of the Kraft process and is concentrated\
    \ in a multiple-efect evaporator using steam. After this step, the black liquor\
    \ has about 20\u201330% solids. The black liquor is further evaporated to 65\u2013\
    80% solids and burned in a recovery furnace to produce steam (which is often supplied\
    \ as process heat to various production steps) and to increase plant energy efciency.\
    \ The green liquor from the recovery furnace is sent to a causticizer where it\
    \ is reacted with lime to convert sodium carbonate to sodium hydroxide. The causticized\
    \ green\nliquor, called white liquor, is returned to the digester for reuse in\
    \ the pulping process while the precipitated calcium carbonate is washed and sent\
    \ to a lime kiln where it is heated to produce calcium oxide.\nThe washed pulp\
    \ is then screened, cleaned, and most of the water is removed to prepare it for\
    \ papermaking. Since the pulp mix contains a signifcant amount of lignin and other\
    \ discoloration materials, the pulp is bleached using water, steam, and chemicals\
    \ to produce light-colored or white papers at a later stage. In the refning process,\
    \ the fbers are brought under compression and shear forces which cause several\
    \ changes in the specifcations of fibers and improve their quality. Water is added\
    \ to the pulp slurry to make a thin mixture containing <1% fiber. \nThe slurry\
    \ is cleaned and screened before being fed into the wet end of the paper-forming\
    \ machine. In the forming section, the fibers present in the slurry form a paper\
    \ web through drainage by gravity and applied suction below the forming fabric.\
    \ In the press section, the remaining water is removed by mechanical pressure\
    \ applied through the nips of a series of presses while the wet web is consolidated.\
    \ The remaining water content is later dried using steam. Calendaring process\
    \ smoothens and compresses the paper material by passing a single continuous sheet\
    \ through a series of heated rolls. The fnal step involves winding and cutting\
    \ the traveling sheet into paper reels."
  158: The steam produced in the recovery furnace could be sufcient for supplying
    heat to the digestor, bleaching machine, and multiple evaporators. Therefore,
    paper drying is assumed to be the only application that requires steam from other
    sources including industrial heat pumps (IHPs). All of the steam condensate from
    the paper drying process can be recovered, requiring no makeup water preheating.

  293: With direct reduction, iron ore pellets are reduced in hydrogen-based DRI plants.
    The process results in sponge iron (direct reduced iron, DRI) and water. The sponge
    iron (together with scrap, if needed) can then be melted into crude steel in an
    electric arc furnace. If hydrogen is produced using 100 per cent renewable energy,
    this route is virtuallyv carbon-neutral. The DRI process requires a certain share
    of (bio)methane as a carbon-containing energy carrier for the formation of foamed
    slag.
  294: "In alkaline iron electrolysis, iron ore is reduced to iron in a caustic soda\
    \ solution at a temperature of 110\xB0C and then melted to produce crude steel\
    \ in an electric arc furnace. The process does not require a carbon-based reduction\
    \ agent,promising to increase energy efficiency relative to the blast-furnace\
    \ route and to be carbon-neutral, provided that renewable electricity is used\
    \ throughout the process. An alternative is to conduct the electrolytic process\
    \ of molten iron ore at high temperatures."
  295: "The HIsarna\xAE process is an innovative, carbon-\nbased smelting reduction\
    \ process that eliminates the\nagglomeration stages (coking plant, sintering/pelleting)\
    \ in steel production. The iron ore, which can be mixed with up to 50 per cent\
    \ scrap, is reduced directly to pig iron in a single reactor. The process is particularly\
    \ suitable for combination with CCS because its exhaust gas consists of comparatively\
    \ pure CO2. Carbon reductions of up to 86 per cent are possible. The electricity\
    \ use of the HIsarna process is around 0.5 MWh per t of crude steel and hence\
    \ comparatively low."
  296: The CCU process captures a portion of the metallurgical gases arising from
    the blast-furnace route and uses them for the production of chemicals such as
    methanol, ethanol, synthetic fuels and ammonia. The gases captured in this process
    no longer have to be burnt and their use in the chemical industry substitutes
    the use of crude oil. However, the low-carbon production of chemicals such as
    methanol (a raw material for plastic production) requires the additional production
    of green hydrogen, which makes this route very electricity-intensive.
  297: Gasification and synthesis of black liquor, a by-product of chemical pulping,
    to produce methanol.
  298: Gasification and synthesis of black liquor, a by-product of chemical pulping,
    to produce heat and power via integrated gasification combined cycle technology.
  299: "Kraft pulping is the most widely used chemical pulping process, which involves\
    \ the use of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) under highly alkaline\
    \ conditions and subject to a temperature between 155 to 180 \xB0C, and a steam\
    \ pressure of 800 kPa as the main cooking conditions to breakdown wood chips into\
    \ pulp [93]. The resulting cooking liquors, known as black liquors, emerge as\
    \ a by-product of the Kraft chemical pulping process, with approximately seven\
    \ tons of black liquors generated per ton of chemical pulp produced [95]. The\
    \ recovery cycle plays a vital role in Kraft production, which includes the recovery\
    \ of energy from black liquors trough evaporator units and recovery boilers, and\
    \ the recovering of pulping chemicals trough causticizing and energy intensive\
    \ lime kiln processes. Black liquors serve as a valuable resource for supplying\
    \ process heat and electricity to pulp and paper production processes through\
    \ combustion boilers and cogeneration processes. "
  300: "Mechanical pulping can be categorized into four types: stone groundwood pulping,\
    \ which entails pressing wood against a rotating grindstone at high speeds (1000\
    \ to 1200 rev/min); refiner mechanical pulping, which involves shredding and grinding\
    \ wood chips between rotating metal discs or plates using a refiner at atmospheric\
    \ pressure; thermo-mechanical pulping, which includes the impregnation and preheating\
    \ of wood chips with steam under pressure and temperatures around 115\u2013155\

  302: "Kraft pulping is the most widely used chemical pulping process, which involves\

    \ a by-product of the Kraft chemical pulping process, with approximately seven\
    \ tons of black liquors generated per ton of chemical pulp produced [95]. The\
    \ recovery cycle plays a vital role in Kraft production, which includes the recovery\

  303: "Mechanical pulping can be categorized into four types: stone groundwood pulping,\

  332: The Cyclone Converter Furnace (CCF) process originated from the Converted Blast
    Furnace (CBF) jointly developed by Hoogovens, British Steel and Ilva in the years
    1986 to 1989. In the CBF process, lumpy ore is highly pre-reduced in a shaft with
    final reduction and melting taking place in an iron bath in which fine coal is
    gasified. The process can avoid coke making but not ore agglomeration and related
    environmental problems. To further eliminate ore agglomeration in the process,
    the Cyclone Converter Furnace (CCF) is developed, in which a melting cyclone is
    applied for pre-reduction and pre-melting of fine ore. A small CCF pilot plant
    was built in Taranto, Italy.

    \ in an electrolyzer \u2013 is fed into a shaft containing pre-heated iron ore\

  342: Electric arc furnace for crude steel production using scrap input.
  343: Regarding the production of ferroalloys, they include a vast category of alloys
    of iron, chromium, silicon, manganese and others. The combined production of ferrochromium
    FeCr, ferromanganese FeMn, ferrosilicon FeSi and silicomanganese SiMn has constituted
    the largest part of global ferroalloys production during the last 20 years (88
    % in 2002, 72 % in 2011 and 65 % in 2015, thus highlighting a constantly decreasing
    trend  ), so a single technology is used to aggregate all ferroalloys (since data
    for energy consumption are only available for the most traditional ferroalloys),
    and its energy consumption is made up by the weighted average of values related
    to the production of the mentioned ferroalloys between 2011 and 2015. On the other
    hand, the JRC-EU-TIMES only considers ferrochromium as representative for the
    entire production field.

  359: In dry and semi dry processes for manufacturing of cement, the raw materials
    are crushed and fed in the correct proportions into a grinding mill. The raw materials
    are dried and reduced in size to a fine powder in to grinding mill. The dry powder
    is called the raw meal. The raw meal is pumped into a blending silo. Adjustment
    in the proportion of the materials required for the manufacture of cement is done
    in silo.

  407: Steam impingement dryers are comparable to air impingement dryers but differ
    in drying medium, as superheated steam is used instead of hot air. Energy use
    is more or less similar to conventional multi cylinder drying [7]. However, since
    the exhaust air is (low pressure) steam, it is possible to recover all latent
    heat which creates large potential for heat recovery. In order to compensate for
    pressure drops, a compressor or fan is required which causes an increase in electricity
    use. Even though the concept of superheated steam drying is more than 100 years
    old, and the technology is already used in other industries, the technology is
    still not commercial in the paper industry [12] as implementation requires a major
    adaptation to the paper making process [7].
  408: Conventional papermaking for soft paper grade.
  409: 'Impingement dryers for soft paper grades are usually used at the beginning
    of the pre- or after dryer section. Due to compact


    design, the dryer makes an excellent rebuild alternative, with minimal building
    modifications and short


    installation time. Steam pressure in the existing dryer cylinders can be increased
    in the early drying stage.


    Impingement drying provides a stronger sheet earlier in the dryer section for
    better runnability. Rapid drying adjustability speeds up grade changes. The final
    product has more uniform moisture and tension profiles and correspondingly higher
    quality. '
  410: Interest in the application of press-drying to paper-making has arisen primarily
    because of the possible improvements to the physical properties of paper using
    high yield pulp furnishes and increasing amounts of hardwood fibres. A major proportion
    of the development work on press-drying has centred around the production of heavy
    paper grades, specifically liner-board.
  411: Impulse drying is a technology used for extracting water from the paper web
    on the machine. The operating principle is based on the displacement of water
    from the paper by steam. The steam is formed in the paper by heating it on one
    side using a pressure roll. This makes the water removal mechanism fundamentally
    different from purely mechanical (compression) or thermal (evaparation) water
    removal processes. Impulse drying can be used for newsprint and writing paper
    qualities. An inherent quality of the operating principle embodied in impulse
    drying is the low energy requirement for dewatering when compared with similar
    dewatering levels obtained using drying rolls (70% less).
  412: Conventional papermaking for graphical paper grade.
  413: "In the Condebelt process, the paper web sits atop two permeable wires and\
    \ is fed into an extended nip between two smooth steel belts. While the upper\
    \ steel belt is heated by high-pressure steam at temperatures of 110\u2013160\xB0\
    C, the lower steel belt is cooled by circulating water at around 80\xB0C. The\
    \ top side of the web is in direct contact with the upper steel belt, while the\
    \ wire side of the web contacts a fine wire with a coarse wire underneath. Vapor\
    \ generated from the web passes through the wires and condenses on the lower steel\
    \ belt. Water condensed on the surface of the lower belt or in the interstices\
    \ of the wires is removed with a doctor or by applying vacuum. A web dried under\
    \ such unsymmetrical conditions will show distinct two-sidedness. However, for\
    \ certain grades such as linerboard and corrugating medium, two-sidedness may\
    \ not be of great concern."
  414: "Airless drying for graphical paper grade. By utilizing the latent heat of\
    \ evaporated moisture and producing steam through the evaporated water, this technology\
    \ can provide 60\u201380% of the required heat for drying (Del Rio et al. 2022)."

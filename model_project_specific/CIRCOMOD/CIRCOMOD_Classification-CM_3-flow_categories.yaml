classification_items_description:
  1: Unique reference product for process desription, flow value agains which all
    other flows are normalized
  2: From Environment (natural resource), elementary flow
  3: 'Input from Technosphere: material'
  4: 'Input from Technosphere: energy carrier'
  5: 'Input from Technosphere: product'
  6: 'Input from Technosphere: service'
  7: 'Input from Technosphere: other (not a material, product, or service)'
  8: use of own by-product
  9: 'Input from Technosphere: feedstock (carbon-based raw material used for non-energy
    purposes)'
  10: 'Input from Technosphere: reductant  (or reducing agent, e.g. coke in blast
    furnace)'
  11: 'Input from Technosphere: recycled material'
  12: 'Input from Technosphere: waste material'
  13: By-product or co-product of activity, but not reference product
  14: 'Flow to Technosphere: waste of activity'
  15: Flow to Environment (Emission), elementary flow
  16: Flow to Environment (Emission), elementary flow, direct
  17: Flow to Environment (Emission), elementary flow, direct as a result of chemical
    transformation
  18: Flow to Environment (Emission), elementary flow, direct as a result of combustion
  19: Flow to Environment (Emission), elementary flow, direct and from bio-based source
  20: Flow to Environment (Emission), elementary flow, as a result of energy and process
    emissions from anode production
  21: Flow to Environment, direct dumping/discharge of solid or liquid waste, use
    only if accounting for emissions is not suitable
  22: Flow to Environment, final storage, final sink, safe disposal. For example CCS
    or sanitary landfill.
  23: Economic input, such as subsidies
  24: Social input, such as labour

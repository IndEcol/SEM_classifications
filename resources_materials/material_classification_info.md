General description of a material: 'Material' as in material flow analysis: substance or good.

Here, we are more specific: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material  "A material is a substance or mixture of substances that constitutes an object." For products (made of different components and materials), there are already various classifications available, which also include (engineering) materials and material products.

Materials can be classified by type of use, type of substance, etc. -->  There is no universal mateiral classification, instead, we need some hierarchical structure with alternative sub-classifications that can also be resorted/rebuilt into a different classification.

For IE/SEM-Research:
Material classification: "A material is a substance or mixture of substances that constitutes an object." Includes both natural materials and processed materials, compound materials and also manufactured products of a single material (like plastic bowls, glass jars), but not manufactured products of higher manufacturing degrees (like electronic components).
